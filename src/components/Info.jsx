        <p className="experience-description">
          A quiet journey through the senses. <br />
          An experience designed to awaken what often goes unnoticed.
          <br />
          Guided by light, scent, sound, and movement, this is yoga that goes
          beyond the physical.
          <br />
          Held in the peaceful surrounds of Sabha, Sensory Circle invites you to
          tune in, feel more, and move with quiet intention.
          <br />
          Leave with a softer body, a quieter mind, and a sense that something
          has gently shifted.
